This is just another Angular 2 (ngx) blog that aims to share those minute details, hickups
and experiences one may encounter when developing a brand new application in Angular.

The author of this blog, {{ author.first_name }} {{ author.last_name }}, is a front-end technology
enthusiast, currently trying to build an application in Angular 2, which he thinks is a wholesome,
awesome framework that is going to go big... I mean, reeeeally big!
